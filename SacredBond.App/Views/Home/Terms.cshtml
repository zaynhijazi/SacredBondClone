    <p><strong>Fraud And Scam Warning</strong></p>
    <p>Sacred Bond specifically and emphatically warns members never to send money to anyone that they meet on our services. A very small number of profiles on our services may not be genuine and may belong to scammers that may manage to slip through our extensive filters and pose as people who they are not. Sacred Bond has no way of determining the validity of any communication that you receive from another Member or the validity of the person behind such communication. We believe that these are few in number, but the damage they can cause may be enormous. These scammers will typically pose as an attractive woman or man. They will initiate contact with other members and will at some point during the interaction request money from the other person. This could be a request in the form of a loan, assistance for food, assistance for medical treatment, assistance to cover travel expenses to visit that member, or assistance to smuggle a fortune out of a particular country. The list is endless. The bottom line is that we are warning our members to never send any money to anyone that they meet on this site for any reason whatsoever. Chances are extremely high that the sending member will be defrauded of that money and will become another unhappy fraud victim. It is a violation of site policy to solicit money from or to send money to any member on the site. It is YOUR responsibility to report any member who asks you for any payment by using the report member feature on their profile.</p>
    <p><strong>Sacred Bond Is Held Harmless</strong></p>
    <p>You explicitly, expressly, and totally understand and agree that Sacred Bond is held harmless by you and anyone else against any wrongdoing, damage, scam, misrepresentation, inappropriate contact, untruthfulness, trickery, or deceit perpetrated against you by any member that you meet on this site or on any of our affiliated sites, or that you meet through Sacred Bond.

From time to time, certain features of the site may not be available. You agree to hold Sacred Bond harmless against any such interruption of service.</p>
    <p><strong>Sacred Bond Content Policy</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sacred Bond™&nbsp;&nbsp;is a SERVICE PROVIDER and makes NO GUARANTEES either on our website or through our marketing that you will definitely find a spouse.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>It is YOUR responsibility to involve your families and do your necessary checks when searching for a spouse.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Follow through with members you meet are YOUR responsibility, and as such, you absolve Sacred Bond of any issues, problems, or other factors that would arise from meeting members or being in touch with them OUTSIDE Sacred Bond.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>It is YOUR responsibility to take the necessary precautions with members you meet through Sacred Bond as you would otherwise take if you were meeting any other potential spouse.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>It is YOUR responsibility to involve your family and your Wali in all your communications OFF or ON Sacred Bond – Sacred Bond cannot and will not be held responsible for any problems which occur with any member of the website.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sacred Bond requires sisters to include their Wali in their communications. Sacred Bond does NOT condone members to meet freely outside the realm of the website and CANNOT be held responsible for any issues or problems that arise as a result of you doing so.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Membership:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your subscription will automatically renew until canceled for each monthly period.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Payments can be canceled anytime through their respective payment gateways.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sacred Bond is constantly reviewing the price of purchased&nbsp;membership. Sacred Bond may, in its sole discretion, adjust the price upwards or downwards at any time.</p>
    <p>REFUNDS are NOT permitted during times of offers and discounts where members have already paid in full. You may NOT cancel your membership to buy a cheaper deal, as your IP address is recorded and we reserve the right to ban your account on this basis.</p>
    <p><strong>Recurring Payment Policy And Cancellation Of Paid Subscription</strong></p>
    <p>All monthly subscriptions automatically rebill at the end of the initial subscription term.</p>
    <p>If you do not wish to be billed again after your initial purchase, you must CANCEL your membership prior to the scheduled re-bill date. If your membership is not canceled before then, we reserve the right NOT to refund you on payments made to us due to your mistake.</p>
    <p>Stolen Cards and Fraudulent Use of Credit Cards – Sacred Bond takes credit card fraud very seriously. Discovery that any member has used a stolen or fraudulent credit card will result in the notification to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.</p>
    <p><strong>Limit On The Number Of Messages</strong></p>
    <p>Sacred Bond imposes a limit on the daily number of messages that any member can send to other members. This is to prevent spam and to ensure that no single member on&nbsp;our services&nbsp;can access an unreasonably large number of members with inappropriate messages or content in a short period of time. The current maximum number of daily email messages that any member can send is 25.</p>
    <p>Sacred Bond reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to increase or to decrease the number of daily permitted emails.</p>
    <p><strong>The Unpredictability Of Messages And Replies</strong></p>
    <p>Some members that you send a message to may not respond to your email message. Although this can be quite frustrating, it could be due to a number of factors. The member you are trying to reach may be talking to other members and is not interested in starting something new. The member may also elect not to respond to you because they are not interested in your profile or they do not see a picture in your profile.</p>
    <p>A refund can NOT be given on the basis of members choosing not to correspond with you. Reasons for members failing to contact you include: the poorly written profile, personal preferences, and wants do not match yours, your profile may not be appealing to others, your personal circumstances may mean your profile is not of interest to others, etc. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but on all such occasions, you CANNOT be refunded.</p>
    <p>It is YOUR responsibility to communicate with members in a polite, respectful manner. Rude, offensive, filthy, disgusting, or vulgar messages or any other inappropriate messages will result in a permanent ban without refund. Similarly, if you find a member behaving like this, please REPORT this person immediately. Although Sacred Bond is a heavily moderated site, on rare occasions the odd profile can slip through our filters. Please report members who are in violation of any of the rules mentioned herein. Sacred Bond cannot be held responsible for any members who are rude, offensive, filthy, vulgar, or trying to scam/fraud anyone. What we WILL do, however, is ban any member found to be in violation of our rules. If need be, personal data CAN and WILL be handed over to law enforcement agencies to aid and assist them in their inquiries.</p>
